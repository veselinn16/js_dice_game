## Game rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his current score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his current score gets lost. After that, it's the other player's turn
- Also, if a player rolls a 6 two *consecutive* times, he loses his current score too
- The player can choose to `HOLD`, which means that his current score gets added to his total score. After that, it's the other player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points in his total score wins the game
